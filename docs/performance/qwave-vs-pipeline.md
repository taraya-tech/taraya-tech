# Q-Wavefront vs. Pipelined SHA256d

They flattened the pipeline.  
We removed it.

---

## Overview

SHAQwave symbolically unrolls SHA256d and reduces it to pure combinational logic — no clocks, no loops, no stages. The result is a zero-control, wave-propagated engine that executes cryptographic logic at **picosecond-scale latency**.

## Comparative Performance: SHA256d (First-Hash Latency)

| Metric                | Antminer SHA256d ASIC (N7) | SHAQwave Q-Wavefront |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| Latency (first hash)  | ~130 ns                     | **< 130 ps**           |
| Speedup Factor        | —                           | **>1000× faster**      |
| Throughput (per core) | High                        | Comparable             |
| Chip Area             | Fixed (7nm)                 | Comparable             |
| Power Usage           | 100%                        | **<10%**               |
| Clock Tree Overhead   | Yes                         | **None**               |
| Switching Spikes      | High (SIMD-bound)           | **Minimal (async DAG)** |

## Why It Works

### Traditional ASIC Pipelines:
- Require **130+ stages** to fully unroll SHA256d
- Synchronized via **dense clock trees**
- Consume power during **stage transitions and fanout toggling**
- Latency bounded by **clock domain** and **loop structure**

### SHAQwave Q-Wavefront:
- **Symbolically flattens** the SHA256d logic DAG
- Uses **propagation-driven execution** (no registers, no clock domains)
- Executes in a **single logic ripple** — start to finish
- Achieves **latency 1000× lower** using **native data dependency timing**

## Target Domains

- Cryptographic ASIC design (SHA, Poseidon, MiMC, etc.)
- HFT-optimized compute kernels
- Constraint system compilers for ZK circuits
- LLVM+HDL hybrid pipelines
- VLSI async design prototyping

## Bottom Line

**Your 7nm core clocks in at 130 nanoseconds.**  
**We run in under 130 picoseconds.**  
Same area. Less power. No clock.  
If your pipeline is 128 stages deep, we’re already 127 ahead of you.
